- explain gen AI and agentic AI

- who here is using github copilot or other gen/agentic AI tools in their day to day work?
- are you always happy with the results?
- why?

- talk about the feedback loop from hell

- decision makers make decisions
- engineers are expected to adopt tools natively and become more productive, bc a license costs $ per user per month
- no one knows what "more productive" means
- a lot of organizations never really measured developer productivity, and most of the cultures do not deserve the name "engineering culture" 
- wdim by "engineering culture"?
- an open and flexible culture that allows exprimentation, learning from failure, and continuous improvement


- and still, most of the time I hear "GitHub Copilot sucks", "it produces bad results", "I want to use Claude"
- but the problem is not the tool, it is the foundational tech itself + a non-existent and or messy engineering culture
- it does not matter if ghcp, cursor, claude code

- why? bc organzational contexts are complex
- when your organizations does not have a fundamental understanding about real problems of developers, there is no engineering culture, no enablement, no change management, no guardrails, and no clear definition of what "productivity" means, then you are in a feedback loop from hell

- but how does the reality of software development look like?

# DEMO

1. talk about the demo repo and show deployed github page
2. quick intro to vs code and github copilot
3. explain prompt files and agent files
4. execute explain project file and js-ts-best-practices prompt file (parallel windows)
5. open a new window and ask ghcp about the issues assigned to me, ask it to beginn to fix issue #1
6. show the code changes, commit, push, wait fot the github action to finish and open an issue
7. assign copilot to the issue
8. execute ui-reverse-engineering agent

- while you are pretty impressed about what you can do with agentic AI, let's ask ourselves some relevant question:
